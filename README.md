## NEXMO Dashboard
This repo contains a demonstration of the Nexmo UI dashboard version utilizing MEAN STACK web development using a mean combination of MongoDb, ExpressJS, AngularJS and NodeJS.
Featured here is a new Nexmo Dashboard UI MEAN build originally based on the initial Customer Dashboard prototype also created by **Chyke** (owner of digitizeThis) for **Nexmo Inc** in 2015.
Visit the developer's projects at **http://www.digitizethis.co.uk/work/web-design/**.
See the complete prototype at http://www.digitizethis.co.uk/e_projects/nexmo/phase1/index.html.

## To view the prototype
* Go to http://www.digitizethis.co.uk/e_projects/nexmo/phase1/index.html
* Fill in dummy details with a vague email address.
* Ensure the passwrd meets the criteria specified.
* Sign up and fill out 2FA authentication with numbers.
* You can now see the dashboard.

The original AngularJS build version of this project is a property of Nexmo Inc who are now using Java instead for the backend, hence the reason for fleshing this out.
This demo therefore provides a demonstration of the developer's skillset in utilizing MEAN STACK web development to build powerful and scalable single-page web applications using a full stack JavaScript environment with Node.js, MongoDB, AngularJS and the Express framework.

## The Dashboard
The Nexmo Customer Dashboard was designed and built for developers from the start with the ability to support enterprise-grade communications solutions. This is a key change in the way you can map users and API keys.

## Feature: Account management
Dashboard is a web application that makes it easy to:
* Manage your account - setup and configure your Nexmo account
* Manage payments - top up your account balance, configure notifications and generate invoices
* Manage numbers - view and buy virtual numbers and short codes
* Analyse your API use - each product has a dedicated page you use to search and interpret the results of your API requests

## MEAN.JS
MEAN.JS is a full-stack JavaScript open-source solution, which provides a solid starting point for [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/), [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/), [Express](http://expressjs.com/), and [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) based applications. The idea is to solve the common issues with connecting those frameworks, build a robust framework to support daily development needs, and help developers use better practices while working with popular JavaScript components.

### Yo Generator
The [Official Yo Generator](http://meanjs.org/generator.html), is used in this project and provides another way to generate a copy of the MEAN.JS 0.4.x boilerplate and supplies an application generator to ease daily development cycles.
