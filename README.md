NEXMO Dashboard
This repo contains a demonstration of the Nexmo UI dashboard version utilizing MEAN STACK web development using a mean combination of MongoDb, ExpressJS, AngularJS and NodeJS.
Featured here is a new Nexmo Dashboard UI work originally based on the initial Customer Dashboard work created by Chyke for Nexmo Inc in 2015. See the complete prototype at http://www.digitizethis.co.uk/e_projects/nexmo/phase1/index.html.

## To view the prototype
Go to http://www.digitizethis.co.uk/e_projects/nexmo/phase1/index.html
Fill in dummy details with a vague email address
Ensure the passwrd meets the criteria specified
Sign up and fill out 2FA authentication with numbers
You can then see the dashboard.

The original Angular version is property of Nexmo who are now using Java instead for the backend, hence the reason for fleshing this out. Hence, this is now a demonstration the developer's skillset in utilizing MEAN STACK web development for building reusable, maintanable web or SPA applications.

## Account management
Dashboard is a web application that makes it easy to:
Manage your account - setup and configure your Nexmo account
Manage payments - top up your account balance, configure notifications and generate invoices
Manage numbers - view and buy virtual numbers and short codes
Analyse your API use - each product has a dedicated page you use to search and interpret the results of your API requests


## Dashboard
The Nexmo Dashboard was designed and built for developers from the start with the ability to support enterprise-grade communications solutions. Today we are announcing a key change in the way you can map users and API keys.

MEAN.JS is a full-stack JavaScript open-source solution, which provides a solid starting point for [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/), [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/), [Express](http://expressjs.com/), and [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) based applications. The idea is to solve the common issues with connecting those frameworks, build a robust framework to support daily development needs, and help developers use better practices while working with popular JavaScript components.
